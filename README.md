# 📚 Source Extractor & Citation Helper

## Overview

This website helps you **create reliable source references** quickly and easily.
Users can paste a **URL** of an article or website, and the program automatically tries to extract key metadata such as:

* **Author**
* **Creation / publication date**
* **Title**

The extracted information is displayed in an **editable table**, allowing users to correct or complete missing data. Once finalized, the sources can be **exported for use in presentations or academic work**.

Additionally, the tool **analyzes the trustworthiness of the source** and warns users if the website may not be reliable.
